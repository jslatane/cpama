# Introducing C

## 1.1 History of C

### Origins

1. Algol 60 - one of the earliest and most influential programming languages
2. BCPL - a systems programming language developed in the mid-1960s
3. B
    - Based on BCPL, designed by Ken Thompson at Bell Laboratories to help further develop UNIX on the DEC PDP-7 minicomputer
    - Dennis Ritchie extended B (New B) to help development of UNIX on DEC PDP-11
4. C
    - As New B diverged more from B, changed to C
    - 1973; UNIX rewritten in C

### Standardization

1. K&R C - *The C Programming Language* by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie (colloquially named K&R) became the standard but was fuzzy on some language features and unclear on which features belonged to C vs UNIX
2. 1983: American National Standards Institute (ANSI) started developing US standard for C
3. C89/C90 - Approved by ANSI in 1989, ISO approved in 1990
4. C99 - ISO published new standard in 1999

### C-Based Languages

- C++: adds classes and other features to support object-oriented programming
- Java: based on C++, inherits many C features
- C#: derived from C++ and Java, popular for Windows app development
- Perl: scripting language, has grown and adopted many features of C
- Python: another popular scripting language with many features of C

## 1.2 Strengths and Weaknesses of C

- Low-level: provides access to machine-level concepts so that programs can be fast
- Small language: limited set of features; relies on a library of standard functions to keep number of features low
- Permissive: assumes the programmer knows what they are doing; doesn't mandate detailed error-checking

### Strengths

- Efficiency: run quickly with limited amounts of memory
- Portability: not a primary goal but turned out to be a strength. Association with UNIX and later standards prevented many incompatible dialects. C compilers small and easily written.
- Power: many data types and operators
- Flexibility: no inherent restriction to any domain, imposes very few restrictions on use of its features
- Standard library: hundreds of functions for I/O, string operations, storage allocation, etc.
- Integration with UNIX

### Weaknesses

- Can be error-prone: due to flexibility, mistakes that would be caught in other languages can't be detected by a C compiler
- Can be difficult to understand: has a number of features that aren't found in other languages; C programs can be terse
- Can be difficult to modify: large programs can be hard to change if not designed with maintenance in mind. No features like classes and packages that support division of a large program into smaller pieces

### Effective Use of C

- Learn how to avoid C pitfalls: book suggestions, modern compilers help
- Use software tools to make programs more reliable:
    - `lint`, traditionally provided with UNIX, subjects a program to a more extensive error analysis than most C compilers.
    - Debuggers
- Use existing code libraries: can reduce errors and save programming effort
- Adopt a sensible set of coding conventions
- Avoid tricks and overly complex code: the shortest solution is often the hardest to understand
- Stick to the standard: compilers provide non-standard language features and library functions that aren't part of the C89 or C99 standards; for portability, avoid using these
