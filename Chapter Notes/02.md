# C Fundamentals

Concepts in this chapter:

- Preprocessing directives
- Functions
- Variables
- Statements

## 2.1 Writing a Simple Program

`pun.c` displays a message each time it is run:

```c
#include <stdio.h>  //Includes info about C's standard I/O library

int main(void)  //Contains the program's executable code
{
    printf("To C, or not to C: that is the question.\n");  //Func from the standard I/O library (stdio)
    return 0;   //Returns the value 0 to the OS when it terminates
}
```

### Compiling and Linking

Steps needed to get `pun.c` to run:

- Create a file named `pun.c` containing the program - the `.c` extension is often required by compilers
- Convert the program to a form that the machine can execute, which usually involves three steps:
    1. ***Preprocessing***: obeys commands that begin with `#` which are called ***directives***. The ***preprocessor*** is like an editor, can add to and modify the program
    2. ***Compiling***: translates the modified program into machine instructions called ***object code***
    3. ***Linking***: combines object code from the compiler with any additional code (like library functions) that are used in the program

Usually the preprocessor is integrated with the compiler.
